## Dissertation Project ‚Äì Hospital Appointment & Health Diary App  

## **June - September 2025**

**Tech stack:** Flutter, Dart, MySQL, OCR (Google ML Kit), HTTP, Git, CLI  

---

## Overview  

Built as my MSc dissertation project, this mobile app supports chronically and seriously ill patients by centralising their healthcare management. It combines appointment scheduling, medication tracking, and daily health logging into one streamlined platform. The system
also supports a user to build a care team on the app to help with the faciliatation of their care and treatment plans. User permissions
were an essential feature to ensure patient health data is secure and private.

## Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Impact  

- **Problem:** Patients with complex healthcare needs often struggle with fragmented records and missed routines.  
- **Solution:** An iOS Flutter app with a built-in OCR for scanning appointment letters, medication trackers, and a symptom tracker with sliders (1‚Äì10).  
- **Impact:** Reduces stress, improves adherence to treatment plans, and makes communication with care-team easier.

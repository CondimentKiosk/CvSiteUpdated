## System Optimisation – EPOS Till Rebuild  

## **2022 (Still undergoing updates)**

**Tech stack:** Database Management, Frontend Configuration, Troubleshooting

## Overview  

During my time at **The Guillemot Deli** in 2022, I independently rebuilt and optimised the café’s **EPOS (Electronic Point of Sale)** till system. The goal was to make it faster, clearer, and more efficient for daily use by staff, while improving the backend’s ability to record stock and sales data.  

This project combined **technical curiosity** with **operational problem-solving**, and gave me the opportunity to self-teach key principles of database structure, interface design, and system debugging in a real business context.

## Problem → Solution → Impact  

- **Problem:** The existing till layout was confusing, slow, and failed to accurately record inventory and sales.  
- **Solution:** Rebuilt the system from scratch by reorganising products alphabetically, introducing colour-coding, and restructuring the backend database to support accurate stock tracking.  
- **Impact:** Improved workflow efficiency, reduced transaction times, and provided management with cleaner, more accurate sales reports.

## **June - August 2025**

**Tech stack:** QA testing tools, Agile methodologies, Trello  

---

## Overview  

From June to August 2025, I volunteered with **TalkTerms**, a Belfast-based startup. My role spanned across QA/testing and UI/UX collaboration, giving me hands-on experience in how agile teams deliver and refine software. This experience highlighted the critical importance of **accessibility** and **user-centered design** in building customer-focused applications.

## Problem → Solution → Impact  

- **Problem:** Startups often face the challenge of balancing rapid iteration with maintaining a seamless and accessible user experience.  
- **Solution:** I contributed to **QA testing** (finding and documenting bugs, verifying fixes) while also sitting in on meetings with the **UI/UX team** to review the design process and accessibility considerations that were discussed.
- **Impact:** Helped the team deliver a smoother, more accessible product and improved my own skills in **cross-functional communication** and **industry workflows**.

## QA Process

I assisted the QA team by working through the various workflows and testing routes to ensure the correct objectives were achieved. This was tested by reviewing whether the correct case numbers and statuses were sent to the dedicated email account. 30 tests per route, across 9 routes, were assigned to me resulting in over 200 tests. Test results had to be updated in the Trello board and any failures or discrepancies were reported to the lead developer.

## Hi, Iâ€™m Josh ðŸ‘‹

{{< figure src="/assets/luna.jpg" width="400px" >}}

I have just completed my MSc Software Development at Queenâ€™s University Belfast, after my dissertaion on building a **hospital appointment tracker and health diary app** was submitted. My mission was to use tech to make healthcare less of a burden for those with chronic and serious illnesses. Now Iâ€™m excited to bring my abilities into industry, contributing my skills while continuing to grow and push my limits.

Before diving into code, I studied History (so I can build systems and talk about how Alexander built his empire). At the moment, Iâ€™m coding in **Java**, managing data with **SQL**, and experimenting with **Flutter**.

## What I Do

- **Java & SQL** â†’ Strong foundations in backend logic + data design.  
- **Flutter & Dart** â†’ Building cross-platform apps.  
- **Projects** â†’ From a LMS to a health app.
- **Certificates** â†’ Including Kainos' Code-Connect and online courses on a variety of topics such as dockerisation and AWS.
- **TalkTerms** â†’ Volunteering with a local tech company to gain valuable industry insights.

## Beyond Education

- Built my own PC from scratch, from picking parts to final assembly.
- Spent 8+ years in the hospitality industry, where I learned the importance of teamwork, and taking leadership, as well as how to stay calm when ten people want flat whites *now*.
- Dedicated 14 years to the Boys' Brigade to gain the highest honour and offering a further 3 years as leader.  
- Raised **Â£1000+** for the Cancer Fund for Children through a skydive.
